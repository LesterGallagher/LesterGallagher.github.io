If you search google for "How to create a free website" you will see a bunch of website builders and websites who will give you a domain like: "yourname.theirname.com" or "theirname.com/yourname". But in this tutorial/guide I will show you the secret to creating a real website completely customizable website. The only payment you will need to do is a 0.89 dollar one year domain 

## Step 1

Go to [https://www.namecheap.com/domains/](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/ "https://www.namecheap.com/domains/") and search for your domain. I would suggest choosing an uncommon domain name try to find one that costs as little as possible. This is probably the best because if you're starting out. You can always buy a more expensive domain later. If you've found a cheap domain it's probably because it's very unique and original so  it's a good thing. One thing to keep in mind though is to keep the domain name as short as possible.
