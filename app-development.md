The development of a mobile or web app is done in three different stages.

* Domain assessment
* Design
* Implementation
* Review/Testing

![](/uploads/lifecycle.svg "Development lifecycle")

Each lifecycle item is an iterative and recursive process. For example, the Design stag will also follow the domain assessment -> implementation -> design -> review/testing lifecycle. The lifecycle is of importance for every stage of development.

We are forward thinking and are adaptive to changes. 

### Domain assessment

We will determine the requirements for the application and lay out a rough model of the system, data and the app. This might also include reading up on specific topics and prototyping. This item in the lifecycle is mostly to plan certain aspects such that we avoid technical debt, vendor lock-in, anti patterns and other pitfalls.

### Design

In this stage we will develop tools, media, a styling plan and other content for the application. This often includes a QA with our customer.

### Implementation
